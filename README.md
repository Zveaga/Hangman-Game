# Project is a work-in-progress ðŸ”¨

The goal of this project is to build a Hangman game. I will first start with a simple version where the game is playable inside the terminal with the game's graphics are comprised of ASCII characters only. Then, to make the game look better and be more playable, I will re-implement it using a C++ graphical library.  <br/>
