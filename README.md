# Project is a work-in-progress ðŸ”¨

The goal of this project is to build a Hangman game. <br/>
I will first start with a simple version with the game playable only inside the terminal with the game's graphics are comprised of ASCII characters. <br/>
Then, to make the game look better and be more playable, I will re-implement it using a C++ graphical library.  <br/>
